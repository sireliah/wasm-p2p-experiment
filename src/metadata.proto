    // Protobuf 3 uses default values for different data types, including bools.
    // This means that "true" value is encoded using 2 bytes, but "false" is 0 bytes.
    // Sending 0 bytes over the socket is problematic, that's why extra field "hash"
    // was added here. Removing the field will likely cause your connection to hang.
